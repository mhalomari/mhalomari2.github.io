Based on my personal experince, I would recommend buying a car from:

** RAC Approved Dealers: **

Every car purchased from RAC Approved Dealers comes with the following:

1. A certificate confirming the vehicle has passed the RAC 82 point Approved Vehicle Preparation Standard
2. A Car Data Check
3. A minimum of 3 months RAC Warranty
4. 12 months RAC Breakdown Cover (Roadside, Recovery, At Home)
5. RAC Accident Care (for the duration of your breakdown cover)


** AA Approved Dealers: **

The best thing here, is that you can part-exchange your old car.
